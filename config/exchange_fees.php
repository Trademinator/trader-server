    | Trusted exchange taker-fee ceilings for training/economic evaluation
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Trademinator training and candle-period selection use the highest known
    | applicable one-side taker fee. If CCXT reports a lower market/account fee,
    | the configured published ceiling wins so training remains conservative.
    | Keep every ceiling sourced and review it when an exchange changes fees.
    |
    | Rates are decimal fractions: 0.002 = 0.20%, 0.005 = 0.50%.
