# Trademinator M plan

Updated 2026-10-07. This plan follows the current Server implementation and preserves the M0–M4.3 foundations. M4.4 adds human-guided supervised learning before Client execution reporting and paper trading in M5.

The M4.2 integration is based on GitHub `main` at `a2c7d8f2e67cf5e1bb7c68db448ced359274f781`. It preserves the owner administration, account suspension, access statistics, syslog, local GeoIP and compression changes already present there. Dashboard routes, model relationships, frontend loading and scheduled recording/discovery are integrated alongside those features.

## Product and responsibility contract

A **market subscription** means the user follows one exact exchange + spot symbol. It enables access to that market's intelligence and contributes to shared Server collection. Subscribing does **not** mean the user holds the asset, allocates funds, enables a strategy, or places an order.

The Client decides whether to trade. An active subscription to the selected exchange + symbol is a prerequisite for that decision; it is not sufficient authorization to trade. Client configuration, balances, execution conditions and risk checks also apply. Do not equate `BTC/USD` on different exchanges, or `BTC/USD` with `BTC/USDT`. Unsubscribing must prevent new subscription-dependent trading decisions; safe handling of existing positions and protective orders belongs to the Client contract in M5.

The Server collects canonical exchange candles, computes features, trains and validates models, and records its signals. It does not infer execution from a subscription or a BUY/SELL signal. The Client owns orders, fills and actual positions. Until authenticated Client reporting exists, the Server displays execution as **Unknown**, never as executed, skipped or zero trades. Billing subscriptions and market subscriptions are separate concepts.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Status in this Server release | Scope and acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 — Stabilization | Existing baseline | Runtime, UUID persistence, canonical candle shape, indicator corrections and isolated in-memory tests. [Details](M0-README.md). |
| M1 — Trustworthy market data | Existing baseline | Exchange OHLCV, closed-candle validation, automatic period selection, shared subscription-driven feeds, bounded collection and resumable history backfill. Period selection is versioned and chooses the shortest data-quality-qualified timeframe that also yields at least 1% BUY and 1% SELL after fee-aware auto-label cleanup; it evaluates seven days, then falls back to 14 days before increasing the timeframe. Existing shared subscriptions are reevaluated automatically without interrupting their current feed. [Details](M1-README.md). |
| M2 — Feature engine | Existing baseline | Causal, versioned indicators and optional timestamped CoinGecko training context. Exchange candles remain authoritative. [Details](M2-README.md). |
| M3 — Research and market onboarding | Existing baseline | Immutable labelled datasets, purged walk-forward evaluation, questionnaire, explained suggestions, explicit subscription and detailed market reviews. [Details](M3-README.md). |
| M4 — Validated intelligence | Existing baseline | KNN selection and validation, patterns, model registry, abstention, readiness and scheduled shared-market training. [Details](CLI.md#m4-intelligence-workflow-and-upgrade). |
| M4.1 — Cross-exchange evidence | Existing baseline | Point-in-time lead/lag evidence, daily reevaluation and downstream model validation. [Details](CLI.md#m41-cross-exchange-leadlag-and-m4-completion). |
| **M4.2 — Dashboard and observation history** | **Implemented here** | Read-only subscription overview, closed-candle charts, persistent Server observations, readiness, changes since visit, attention states, broad market context and explained discovery. Acceptance below. |
| **M4.3 — Portable archive and cold-history storage** | **Implemented** | Verified monthly gzip JSONL ticker archives, portable data contract, archive catalog, transparent hot+cold ticker reads, feature checkpoints, OWNER recovery tools and portable export/import. Initial rollout remains export/verify only: automatic pruning is disabled. [Details](M4.3-README.md). |
| **M4.4 — Outcome + Action supervised intelligence** | **Implemented** | Outcome KNN predicts five forward market states over a market-derived horizon; Action KNN predicts BUY/HOLD/SELL. Human Outcome Training and Human Action Training are independent sources inside their matching KNN, with dynamic capped influence. |
| **M5 — Decisions, paper trading and Client integration** | **Implemented** | Versioned subscription-gated Client API, hashed multi-key authentication, explicit per-market trading/paper selection, expiring risk-gated decision context, cost-aware paper evaluation, immutable idempotent execution/fill reports and dashboard provenance. The Server still does not hold exchange credentials or place orders. |
| M6 — Commercial access | Planned | Stripe/PayPal billing, renewals, entitlements and limits through the existing market-subscription entitlement boundary. Purchasing a plan must never enable trading. |
| **M7 — Optimizations and internal data API** | **In progress** | Performance work that preserves model/data semantics: one canonical OHLCV read gateway, bounded shared Redis history caching, SQL-visible generated metadata for JSON predicates, KNN hot-path optimization and profiling-led indicator work. |
| **M8 — Distributed platform** | **Planned** | Scale the existing Server across configurable web, API, scheduler and worker roles, with shared state, durable artifacts, coordinated jobs and independent workload capacity. Start with one project; evaluate a separate API project only when a demonstrated boundary justifies it. |

## M7 acceptance gates — optimizations and internal data API

1. **One OHLCV payload gateway:** application and page features that need candle payloads use `TickerRepository::streamHistory()` as the canonical read entry point. Metadata-only operations such as timestamp paging, counts, min/max timestamps, archive enumeration, export cursors and write-conflict checks may query indexed ticker columns directly.
2. **Transparent hot+cold semantics:** the gateway preserves M4.3 behavior by merging authoritative hot MariaDB rows and verified cold archive rows chronologically, accepting identical overlap and rejecting conflicting overlap.
3. **Bounded shared cache:** explicitly bounded ranges whose theoretical candle count is at most `TICKER_HISTORY_CACHE_MAX_ROWS` may be materialized in the configured shared cache (Redis by default). Larger or unbounded history remains generator-driven and is never converted into a giant cache value.
4. **Short TTL, explicit invalidation:** cached decoded ranges and timestamp pages default to 30 seconds. Production ticker writes/corrections/imports/derived rebuilds rotate a market+symbol+period generation token so stale entries become unreachable immediately; old entries expire naturally. Cache failure is fail-open.
5. **Shared-market reuse:** user-facing chart and market-evidence readers reuse the same cached market/period ranges across users. The cache contains public market history only; it is not user-specific.
6. **JSON predicate extraction:** on MariaDB 12.3, SQL-filtered ticker metadata such as `payload.derived_from` is exposed as an indexed virtual generated column. OHLCV fields stay in the portable JSON payload until profiling proves persistent columns worthwhile.
7. **Internal API review gate:** regression coverage scans application/page OHLCV consumers and rejects reintroduction of direct `Ticker::query()` payload reads. New features needing OHLCV must route through the repository gateway.
8. **KNN hot path:** P2 validates/casts vectors once before repeated scans and uses bounded early distance rejection without changing vector values, distance semantics or model version.
9. **Indicator optimization is profiling-led:** P1 rolling-indicator work remains deferred until measurements show it is material. Exact BCMath technical calculations remain unchanged unless a separately versioned numerical contract is approved.

## M8 acceptance gates — distributed platform

**Status: planned.** The initial production home is `server.trademinator.com`, serving the existing web interface and Client API together. This milestone introduces deployment roles; those controls are not implemented by this roadmap update.

**Recommended initial architecture:** deploy the same Laravel project and compatible release to each node, with explicit, composable roles selecting the work that node performs. A dedicated API node can run the existing project without serving the dashboard or processing collection/training jobs. Sharing a codebase keeps authentication, subscription entitlements, questionnaire risk, signal semantics and migrations consistent while allowing different workloads to scale separately.

| Proposed node role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Web | Dashboard, account/owner administration and human-training interfaces. |
| API | Existing authenticated, versioned Client API and its request/reporting operations. |
| Scheduler | Dispatch shared scheduled work with cluster-wide overlap and election locks. |
| Worker | Drain only its configured queues; initially `default`, `history`, `intelligence` and `archive`, with independent worker capacity and resource budgets. |

One machine may combine all roles; additional machines may combine any supported subset. These are deployment roles, separate from user/owner authorization roles.

1. **Explicit role enforcement:** define validated, configuration-cache-safe node settings and a documented combined-node default. Enforce roles at HTTP route registration, scheduled-work entry points and worker startup, not merely by hiding navigation. Reject invalid role/queue combinations. Separate node workload selection from platform feature flags: an API node that does not train must still be able to serve enabled, validated intelligence.
2. **Stable public endpoints:** retain `server.trademinator.com` for the current combined application. A future `api.trademinator.com` may initially reach the same deployment and later a dedicated API pool without changing API contracts. `console.trademinator.com` is optional for a future separate web interface. API-only nodes expose the intended API and health routes, with existing authentication, subscription checks, revocation, throttling and response expiry; owner/web routes remain unavailable there. Define host routing, generated URLs, session-cookie scope and a compatibility period for existing Clients before moving an endpoint.
3. **Shared state and durable files:** use the same authoritative database, persistent queue backend, shared sessions where required, and shared atomic-lock-capable cache with consistent namespaces. Preserve the encryption key wherever existing encrypted state is consumed. Models, research datasets, cold archives and portable import/export staging must be accessible to every role that needs them through durable shared storage; the database alone is insufficient. Preserve checksums and atomic publication. Rebuild local configuration/runtime metadata per node and grant only the required storage and secret access.
4. **Coordinated background work:** retain the cron-driven worker model in [CRONTABS.md](CRONTABS.md), including finite runs, memory budgets and retry reservations longer than job timeouts. Multiple scheduler/worker nodes must preserve database leases, unique generation keys, idempotent writes and shared locks. Keep node-local CCXT metadata refresh distinct from shared scheduler dispatch. Enforce applicable exchange/provider rate budgets across the worker pool; adding hosts must not accidentally multiply requests against a shared quota.
5. **Independent capacity:** isolate CPU-heavy training/backfill/archive work from web/API capacity and measure queue delay separately from request latency. Review the current shared intelligence queue before promising timely signal recording under training load. An API request must not synchronously rebuild history or train a model. Unavailable dependencies, missing artifacts and stale evidence retain explicit unavailable/abstention behavior; loss of shared coordination must not silently fall back to independent local locks.
6. **Deployment and operations:** document role-specific environment examples, crons, storage mounts, permissions, health/readiness checks and node/queue observability. Coordinate migrations once per release, compatible code/job/artifact versions, worker draining and rollback. Include the desktop-to-server cutover: stop old dispatchers, finish active work, pause writes, complete the final file sync, verify dependencies/artifacts, then enable the new roles. A host move alone must not require model retraining.
7. **Acceptance evidence:** verify equivalent API authorization and results on combined and API-only nodes, unavailable routes/workloads on disabled roles, duplicate-safe scheduling with two nodes, worker failure/redelivery, and readable checksum-verified artifacts across nodes. Confirm adding a worker preserves rate limits and show request latency/queue-delay measurements. Update [CLI.md](CLI.md) and [CRONTABS.md](CRONTABS.md) alongside implementation changes.

**Separate API project decision:** keep extraction open rather than making it a prerequisite for distribution. Revisit it when independent release cadence, dependency footprint, a stronger trust boundary or measured operating constraints justify the extra maintenance. Define ownership of authentication, entitlements, shared domain logic, database migrations and API compatibility before extracting anything; avoid copying business rules into a second project.



## M4.4 Outcome + Action KNN contract

- Outcome KNN predicts SUPER BEAR / BEAR / NEUTRAL / BULL / SUPER BULL.
- H is frozen per dataset from the frequency-weighted mean candle distance between consecutive opposite BUY/SELL Action pivots: H = round(sum(d * freq) / sum(freq)).
- Outcome target: regress log(CLOSE) over t..t+H. With slope beta and V = ATR_t / Close_t, use M = tanh(beta * sqrt(H) / V). Boundaries are [-1,-0.60), [-0.60,-0.20), [-0.20,0.20], (0.20,0.60], (0.60,1].
- Action KNN predicts BUY / HOLD / SELL from the existing retrospective fee-aware auto-label algorithm.
- Outcome and Action tune independent K values. Candidates below K=4 are skipped.
- Human Outcome Training and Human Action Training never overwrite algorithmic labels. For either KNN, W_H = min(0.60, 0.60 * sqrt(N_H / 750)); W_A = 1 - W_H. If one source abstains, the supported source receives 100% effective weight.
- Final matrix: SELL with SUPER BEAR/BEAR/NEUTRAL => SELL; SELL with BULL/SUPER BULL => HOLD. HOLD => HOLD. BUY with SUPER BEAR/BEAR/NEUTRAL => HOLD; BUY with BULL/SUPER BULL => BUY.
- Existing old-version models and frozen semantic datasets must be rebuilt; they are never silently reinterpreted.
- INTELLIGENCE_MAX_SECONDS defaults to 1800 seconds. Intelligence workers use --timeout=2200.

## M4.2 acceptance and implementation

- **Overview:** paginated active subscriptions, recent exchange price sparklines, current validated-model count, collection/history attention and recorded signal changes. Counts labelled “on this page” cover that page; the subscription total and changes count cover all active subscriptions.
- **Selected market:** up to 360 valid closed candles from its selected feed period, volume, UTC timestamps, manual refresh, visible-tab minute refresh and a last-10-candle table. The Server never combines exchange/period series or invents missing candles. Invalid rows, gaps and stale history are explicit.
- **Signal journal:** new shared `market_signals` observations record the original model, period, source decision time, actual recording time, action, reason, horizon and available confidence/evidence. The application rejects updates to existing observations. Consecutive repeats of the same model/source/action/reason/regime reuse the observation; state changes and later source candles append. A recovery after an intervening state is a new observation. No retrospective predictions are presented as decisions made in the past.
- **Chart markers:** BUY, SELL, supported HOLD and waiting states represent Server observations. Markers show state/model/regime changes, up to 200 within the chart range. Each appears on the first candle opening at or after the actual recording time, once that candle closes; the journal retains exact timestamps. A signal is never drawn before it was recorded. These markers are not entry prices, exit prices or fills.
- **Readiness and explanation:** reuse M4's history, model-build and validation gates. Deliberate HOLD remains distinct from insufficient evidence. An expired directional signal is not advertised as current. History ETA is conditional; validated-model ETA is unknown. Confidence is not a probability of profit.
- **Changes since visit:** remember the user's previous dashboard visit, holding the boundary stable during a 30-minute browsing session. First visit uses the last 24 hours. Show up to 20 changed observations across that user's active subscriptions, with an overall count.
- **Subscription coverage:** flag repeated base assets among the displayed subscriptions. This is coverage of followed markets, not positions, allocations or a measured portfolio correlation.
- **Discovery:** use the current user's encrypted questionnaire and saved exchange. Apply existing availability, regional, funding, goal, exclusions, affordability and historical-risk screens. CoinGecko's coin-wide 24-hour volume / market cap breaks ties between otherwise comparable preference matches. It does not establish exchange liquidity or a buy recommendation. Missing history remains exploratory; activity cannot override exclusion or risk gates.
- **Private suggestions:** exclude already followed markets and that user's 30-day dismissals before the bounded shortlist. Review links recheck the dashboard shortlist and stored evidence. Review and an explicit subscription action are required before following a suggested market. No discovery read creates markets, subscriptions, feeds, orders or canonical training context.
- **Market conditions:** optional fresh global market-cap change, BTC dominance, volume and up to five category movements. Exchange charts never use CoinGecko prices. Global discovery cache is isolated from M2's point-in-time training snapshots.
- **Access and failure handling:** dashboard, charts and discovery require a verified session. Chart/detail access requires that user's active subscription. Client execution is always Unknown. Empty history, no model, stale context, API errors, disabled discovery, missing preferences and chart-library failure have readable states. Background discovery does not block the dashboard request.

The subscription access requirement is enforced for the Server dashboard/chart/intelligence routes now. M4.2 cannot enforce exchange orders made independently by a Client; the Client API and its pre-trade subscription check are explicit M5 acceptance gates.

## M4.3 acceptance gates — portable archive and cold-history storage

1. Treat the active database as **hot storage** and the filesystem archive as a slower but fully usable **cold storage tier**. Archiving must not mean data is unavailable: historical consumers must be able to request a range and receive one chronological stream assembled from active database rows plus any required archived ranges.
2. Archive historical data in **monthly shards**. The baseline portable representation is newline-delimited JSON compressed with gzip (`.jsonl.gz`), with a small adjacent JSON manifest for every shard. Do not use SQL dumps or database-native serialization as the canonical archive format.
3. Define and version a Trademinator portable-data contract so archives can be produced on MariaDB and imported into MariaDB, PostgreSQL or another supported database. Preserve exact values across engines: UUIDs and timestamps have canonical representations, decimal/financial values are serialized losslessly, nullability and logical field names are explicit, and format/schema versions are recorded in manifests.
4. Maintain an archive catalog in the active database with at least the logical data type, market identity where applicable, period, covered time range, row count, format/compression version, filesystem location, SHA-256 checksum, compressed size, verification state and timestamps. Prefer range-level catalog records over per-row archive flags; do **not** add a `tickers.learned` boolean merely to decide whether raw candles may be removed.
5. The archive catalog must support runtime fallback. A historical reader must first use hot data, identify missing covered ranges, resolve the necessary monthly shards through the catalog, stream/decompress only those shards, validate their manifests/checksums and merge the records in canonical order. It must not require loading an entire archive into memory.
6. If the same logical record exists in both hot storage and an archive, identical data is acceptable; conflicting values are an integrity error and must never be silently resolved. Gaps, overlaps, missing files, checksum failures, unsupported format versions and malformed rows must be explicit failures or degraded states.
7. Before any database rows become eligible for deletion, archive creation must be crash-safe and independently verified: finish and close the compressed shard, persist its manifest, verify SHA-256 and row count, reopen/decompress it, validate the first/last logical keys and record coverage, and mark the catalog entry verified. A failed or incomplete archive leaves source rows untouched.
8. Initial M4.3 rollout is **export/verify without automatic pruning**. Automatic removal of hot rows is enabled only after restore/re-read behavior is proven and recursive feature state can resume efficiently. Raw archived data remains the correctness/recovery source even when faster checkpoints exist.
9. Add versioned **feature/indicator checkpoints** for recursive state such as EMA/Wilder calculations so normal feature rebuilding can resume near the hot/archive boundary instead of replaying all history. Missing or invalid checkpoints must fall back to archived raw candles, preserving full reproducibility at the cost of slower processing.
10. Start archival eligibility with immutable/high-volume history: `tickers` is the primary target, followed by appropriate historical `market_features`, `market_context_snapshots`, `market_signals` and access-statistics ranges once their restore semantics are defined. Live relational/configuration state, subscriptions, feeds and other bounded operational tables are not cold-archive candidates merely because they contain old timestamps.
11. Add OWNER-only archive administration: list catalog coverage and health, inspect ranges, verify one/all shards, restore selected ranges, rebuild the catalog by scanning manifests on disk, and surface missing/corrupt/overlapping/gapped archives. The filesystem must contain enough manifest metadata to reconstruct the catalog after loss of the active database.
12. Add OWNER-only portable **export/import**. Export supports complete or selected logical datasets and may bundle the monthly JSONL+gzip shards/manifests into a compressed portable package. Import always performs a validation pass before mutation, reports prerequisites/conflicts, supports idempotent re-import of identical records, and never silently overwrites differing data.
13. Full-server portable exports must exclude secrets by default (application keys, passwords, exchange/API credentials and other protected configuration). If sensitive configuration is ever supported, it requires an explicit separate encrypted export path rather than embedding secrets in the ordinary portable dataset.
14. Provide CLI equivalents for automation and recovery, including portable export/import, archive verify/scan/catalog rebuild, archive/restore operations and a dry-run or validate-only mode. Commands must stream bounded chunks and remain safe for large histories.
15. Keep **archive** and **backup** semantics separate. Archives reduce hot database size while remaining queryable cold history; disaster-recovery backups protect the complete running service. The portable format may assist recovery and migration, but M4.3 must not present archive shards as a substitute for normal database/filesystem backups.

## M4.4 acceptance and operation

- **Access:** `/human-training` is available to the verified, active `OWNER_UUID` and verified, active user UUIDs listed in `HUMAN_TRAINING_TRAINER_UUIDS` (comma-separated). Ordinary users cannot read or submit reviews. Trainers can only open their own assignments; only the owner can inspect aggregate agreement or export the full dataset. This is an explicit server-wide training role, independent of market subscriptions.
- **Snapshots:** start from a current, checksum-verified M3/M4 semantic dataset. Randomly assign an unseen candle, freeze up to 90 closed candles through its decision time using the M4.3 hot/cold reader, retain the dataset's feature schema/vector and causal partial-pattern metadata, and preserve the source feature digest. Missing, corrected or invalid source candles are rejected. Gaps are displayed, never filled. Future candles, objective outcomes and other trainers' answers are never sent to the labeling screen. The frozen chart never polls live data. Model observations recorded by the cutoff are shown only after submission; a newer model is never used to invent a historical observation.
- **Labels:** Super Bull / Bull / Neutral / Bear / Super Bear, optional self-rated confidence (0–100) and reason (2,000 characters). Skip is available. UUID provenance includes trainer, snapshot, source dataset, market/period/candle, schema/version, shown/submitted times and snapshot checksum. One immutable answer per trainer and candle; multiple independent trainers can review the same snapshot. Assignments expire after 60 minutes. Refreshing or replaying a submission does not add another vote. Outcome Training is five-class and independent from Action Training; old frozen Outcome datasets are versioned and must be rebuilt for the new target definition.
- **Agreement:** the owner sees exact-label agreement and disagreement across up to the latest 1,000 reviewed snapshots. Agreement is a consistency measure, not a profitability/reputation score. Each trainer has one equal vote; confidence is metadata, not voting power. Training uses current authorized trainers, requires the configured minimum number of reviewers and agreement (defaults: one reviewer, 67%), and excludes ties. Removing a trainer affects subsequent builds, not immutable past artifacts.
- **Independent learning:** Outcome KNN learns five-class forward slope outcomes; Action KNN learns retrospective BUY/HOLD/SELL actions. Both have algorithmic and optional Human Training sources. Human Outcome Training feeds only Outcome KNN; Human Action Training feeds only Action KNN. Pattern/lead-lag evidence remains part of the causal market feature path.
- **Evaluation:** Outcome and Action algorithmic validation each retain chronological tuning and a separate holdout. Human Action uses 60/20/20 chronological training/tuning/holdout with horizon purging. Natural versus target-prior class weights are selected on tuning only. Its gates measure agreement with human actions, not agreement with automatic labels or profitability. After validation, each model retains all eligible examples in the shared age window. Today's annotations make this retrospective research, not historical live performance.
- **Publication:** Outcome KNN and Action KNN predict independently and then pass through the fixed decision matrix. Within each KNN, algorithmic and Human Training sources use dynamic weights: W_H = min(0.60, 0.60 * sqrt(N_H / 750)) and W_A = 1 - W_H; if one source abstains, the supported source receives 100% effective weight. New artifacts require rebuilding old model versions. No trade/order execution is added.
- **Export:** owner download or `trademinator:human-training-export` writes versioned JSONL with a manifest, immutable snapshots, submitted reviews and a checksum footer. Trainer UUIDs are retained; account names, emails, passwords and API keys are excluded. The checksum covers every preceding byte including line endings. This is an export for research/provenance; importing trusted production models remains unsupported.

Existing annotation data remains valid after compatibility checks. No new migration, assets, queue or cron entry is required for two-KNN scoring. Run `trademinator:knn-build EXCHANGE SYMBOL PERIOD` (or use `--dataset=UUID`) to rebuild each old model. See [INTELLIGENCE-RECOVERY.md](INTELLIGENCE-RECOVERY.md) for settings, scoring and deployment; [CLI.md](CLI.md#trademinatorhuman-training-export) documents export.

## M5 acceptance gates


1. Define and implement authenticated, versioned Client access to the exact subscribed market, with active-subscription checks on every request, revocation behavior and expiring responses. The Client must check subscription eligibility immediately before a new trade decision and fail closed when it cannot establish eligibility. Define safe position-exit/protective-order behavior separately.
2. Keep **following**, **Client trading enabled**, **Server signal**, **Client decision** and **exchange fill** as independent states. Trading selection is an explicit Client setting and defaults off; neither subscription nor billing toggles it.
3. Add risk and decision checks appropriate to the user's Client settings, funds, fees, spread, freshness, exposure and exchange constraints. Save the reason for each Client action or intentional skip.
4. Add paper trading with position state, costs, drawdown and an appropriate passive benchmark over matching periods. Keep paper, historical backtest and reported live results separate; show sample size, observation window and costs. Do not derive a portfolio return from a stream of classification labels.
5. Add optional, authenticated and idempotent Client reports linked to the immutable Server signal ID: acted, skipped with reason, rejected/failed, pending and fills (including partial fills). Scope all reports and balances to their owner. No report means Unknown. A Server HOLD or abstention is not a Client skip.
6. Extend charts with separately styled, timestamped Client decisions and actual fill prices only when supported by those reports. Show decision latency, execution differences and outcomes with their provenance. Preserve the original signal if a model later changes.
7. Add user-selected alerts and digest preferences after the event/reporting contract is established. Extend the existing restricted owner reports and syslog monitoring with actionable worker/collection/model failure alerts. Preserve their access controls and keep raw worker errors and private account data off user dashboards. See [existing owner administration and operations](CLI.md#owner-administration-syslog-and-local-geoip).

## Deployment and verification

The dashboard migration for the journal, dismissals and visit timestamp is already included in GitHub `main`. M4.3 adds the archive catalog and feature-checkpoint migration but no Composer/npm dependency. Build frontend assets and apply pending migrations before serving the archive tools or schedules:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm ci
npm run build
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan schedule:list
```

Use the existing persistent queue, shared atomic-lock-capable cache and cron-driven `intelligence` worker. Signal recording runs every minute; inference can be delayed by queue load and does not reconstruct missed historical decisions. The first journal entry is created when the recorder first runs, not on page load. Retained observations consume storage and need normal backup/capacity planning; this release does not silently prune history.

`DASHBOARD_SIGNALS_ENABLED` and `DASHBOARD_DISCOVERY_ENABLED` default to `true`. Signal recording also respects `INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED`. CoinGecko discovery respects `COINGECKO_ENABLED` and requires `COINGECKO_API_KEY`; its hourly refresh is separate from subscription-driven context collection. Discovery consumes at most 15 HTTP requests per default refresh (global, up to 100 coin summaries, at most 12 symbol checks and categories), shared across all users; account plan limits still apply. It uses a shared lock and the scheduler runs it in the background. Cached source data expires within two hours, including category timestamps. If a refresh fails, still-fresh cache remains usable; expired context cannot influence suggestions.

See [CLI.md](CLI.md#trademinatordispatch-market-signals) for immediate dispatch and [CRONTABS.md](CRONTABS.md#m42-dashboard-recording-and-discovery) for deployment requirements. Existing M0–M4.1 data and model artifacts are preserved. A new model build is optional to populate `horizon_candles` when using an older artifact without its label definition; unknown horizon is displayed honestly.

Integration verification includes the owner/access/syslog features together with the dashboard. The full PHP suite uses SQLite `:memory:` only:

```bash
php artisan test --compact
node --test tests/Frontend/*.test.mjs
npm run build
```

The standard PHP suite uses SQLite `:memory:` only. Follow [the test safety rules](M3-R1-RECOVERY.md); never aim tests at deployment databases.

- **Degraded KNN availability:** Action-only SELL/HOLD are preserved while BUY becomes HOLD; Outcome-only becomes HOLD. Client execution never opens a new BUY from degraded intelligence.
